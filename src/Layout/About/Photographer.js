			<p className="about__content">KLiK was started in 2008 by Krystle Foley (Keppers), in Faribault MN, where she was raised and graduated from FHS. The KL &amp; K in KLiK are her maiden name initials and is pronounced like a camera "click".</p>
			<p className="about__content">While in high school, Krystle won state awards for her photography in the school year book and newspaper which helped her realize that others were enjoying her work, as much as she enjoyed capturing them. When she was just 15 years old, Krystle's Dad passed away from cancer (at just 39 years old.) In October 2015, Krystle had surgery to have cancer removed as well, so she knows how much things like this affect families and also understands why photos with your loved ones are so important. Because of this, she loves to give back and donates to many benefits throughout the year to families going through simular stuff in the community. </p>
 	 		<p className="about__content">Being that Krystle self taught in photography (besides for a newborn safety and posing workshop) her work continues to evolve as she is learning, as well as her studio space. She started the business out of her home offering photo shoots to friends and family. Her small business took off very fast. Krystle got into a space at the Faribo West Mall, and within 6 months, moved to a space triple the size.  She then moved to an even bigger space on Central Ave in Faribault,  then in 2017 she built a new studio on 7 acres in the outskirts of Faribault.</p>
 			<p className="about__content"> Her bubbly, fun, outgoing personality keeps her customers coming back and feeling more like friends and family. Whether  you are someone who has been coming to her for photos since she started or a new customer you will be greeted with a smile, and always welcomed at KLiK</p>
