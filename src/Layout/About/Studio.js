				<h1 className="about__title title">Studio</h1>
				<p className="about__content">Our studio is located on 7 acres in rural Faribault, close to Medford MN. KLiK has a full indoor studio with over 200+ backdrops, as well as 7 acres full of different sets including 2 vintage trucks. A teal 1950 Ford F-100 and a 1937 Red Studebaker have quickly became some of her customers  favorite props to use for outdoor photos. There is also a rusty tin shed with an attached spiral staircase, a white wood barn, and of course tons of trees, tall grass and open areas that are all perfect for photos. 98% of the photos you see on the website and facebook are done right at her studio.</p>
				<p className="about__content">Krystle loves being able to offer her customers the option of doing half of their session inside and the other half outside, all inside, or all outside, depending on what they would like. </p>
